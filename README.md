## My Process
### Built with
- Node.js 
- Express.js 
- Handlebars.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize ORM
- Cloudinary
- Heroku

### What we learned

By doing this group project, we feel more comfortable with merging branches and resolving merge conflicts. In addition, we also became familiar with deploying our application with Heroku and MySQL database. Last but not least we are introduced to a new technology called Cloudinary which allows a user to upload images or videos on a website.
